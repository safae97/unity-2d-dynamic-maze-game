# coloborative project
Welcome to our GitHub repository for the dynamic maze game project that I'm working on with my colleague @fatimazahrae03 as part of our first year in software engineering. This project marks our first foray into game development, where we aim to utilize Unity along with principles from graph theory to create an engaging and dynamic maze experience.

# Project Overview
Introduction

Our dynamic maze game offers a unique and challenging experience, diverging from traditional static mazes. By leveraging graph theory, we've created a world where the maze evolves with each playthrough, ensuring endless replayability and excitement.

Game Structure

The game consists of four interconnected scenes, each representing a different maze. These mazes are dynamically generated using graph algorithms, ensuring a fresh experience every time. Each scene also includes coins, enemies, and a gem that marks the end of the maze.

Scene Dynamics

Scene 1 and 3: These scenes follow a traditional maze exploration format. Players must navigate the maze to find the gem, which triggers the generation of a new scene.
Scene 2: This scene offers an automated experience. Players choose a traversing algorithm (A*, Dijkstra, or BFS) to guide the hero to the end in the shortest possible time.
Scene 4: A timed challenge awaits in this scene. Players must reach the gem before the timer expires, adding an extra layer of pressure and excitement.
Graph-Based Maze Generation

The mazes are generated using graph theory, allowing for complex and diverse structures. By manipulating the graph's nodes and edges, we can create mazes with varying difficulty levels and unique characteristics.

# Technologies and Tools
Unity: I have chosen Unity as the game engine for this project beacause the professor recommeneded it and also  due to its versatility, ease of use, and robust capabilities for game development.
Graph Theory Algorithms: Throughout the project, I will apply various graph theory algorithms and concepts to generate, manipulate, and solve the dynamic mazes.
C# Programming Language: Unity development primarily relies on C# for scripting gameplay mechanics and interactions, and I will be utilizing this language extensively.


# Project Goals
So far we implemented the backtracking algorithm to dynamically generate the maze, and  we are working on how much graph theory's algorithms we can impliment to create this game. 

I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community to enhance and improve the project. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, your input is valuable in shaping the direction of this project.


# Conclusion
I am excited about the potential of this dynamic maze game project that i will create with my colleague and the opportunity to apply graph theory concepts that we study seperately to game development. Together, let's embark on this journey of exploration, learning, and creativity in the world of game development.

Happy coding, and let's build something amazing together! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
