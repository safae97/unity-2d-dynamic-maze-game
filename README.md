## unity-2d-dynamic-maze-game ##


Welcome to my GitHub repository for the dynamic maze game project that I'm working on as part of my first year in software engineering. This project marks my first foray into game development, where I aim to utilize Unity along with principles from graph theory to create an engaging and dynamic maze experience.

# Project Overview
The dynamic maze game is an exciting endeavor where players navigate through a maze that evolves and changes dynamically. Unlike traditional static mazes, this game adapts to player interactions and presents new challenges with each playthrough.


# Technologies and Tools
Unity: I have chosen Unity as the game engine for this project beacause the professor recommeneded it and also  due to its versatility, ease of use, and robust capabilities for game development.
Graph Theory Algorithms: Throughout the project, I will apply various graph theory algorithms and concepts to generate, manipulate, and solve the dynamic mazes.
C# Programming Language: Unity development primarily relies on C# for scripting gameplay mechanics and interactions, and I will be utilizing this language extensively.


# Project Goals
So far we implemented the backtracking algorithm to dynamically generate the maze, and  we are working on how much graph theory's algorithms we can impliment to create this game. 

I welcome contributions, feedback, and suggestions from the community to enhance and improve the project. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, your input is valuable in shaping the direction of this project.


# Conclusion
I am excited about the potential of this dynamic maze game project that i will create with my colleague and the opportunity to apply graph theory concepts that we study seperately to game development. Together, let's embark on this journey of exploration, learning, and creativity in the world of game development.

Happy coding, and let's build something amazing together! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
